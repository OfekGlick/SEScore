# Correction rate graphes

We experiment on the datasets wmt21.news.zh-en and wmt21.tedtalks.zh-en, and we test on our model, BERTScore, COMET-DA_2020, bleurt-21-beta, and Prism. 

For every source sentences, we generate machine translation pairs based on their human score difference. Then, for every metrics, we computed how many pairs are correct with respect to the human score.
